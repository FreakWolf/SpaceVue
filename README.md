## Core Tasks

1. **Design Mockup:**
    - A low-fidelity mockup of the dashboard showing the placement of the AG-Grid table and charts (pie and bar charts recommended).

2. **Development:**
    - Implement a mock login page with a simple form and hardcoded login functionality.
    - Build a dashboard with React that uses AG-Grid to display the space missions in a tabular format.
    - Create at least one chart displaying data from the missions (for example, a pie chart showing the proportion of successful missions).

## Technical Requirements

- React.js for frontend development.
- AG-Grid for rendering the table.
- A charting library like AG-Chart, Chart.js, or Recharts for creating charts.
- Fetch and display the provided data with mock API fetching using static data.
